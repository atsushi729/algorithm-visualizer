            First of all, What is "Algorithm"? Well, an algorithm is a general
            and simple set of step-by-step instructions that a digital computer
            can execute to solve problem. For it to be practical, it must
            accomplish this within a limited number of steps. Thus, An algorithm
            is defined on specified inputs and generates an output.

            <li>
              <strong>Finiteness </strong> : An algorithm must terminate after a

              a sequence of steps and ultimately produce a result.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Definiteness</strong> : Each step of an algorithm must be

            <li>
              <strong>Input </strong>: An algorithm can take zero or more

              solve the problem.

            <li>
              <strong>Effectiveness </strong>: Each step of the algorithm must

                A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure used to locate
                specific data among a collection of data. It is considered a
                fundamental procedure in the field of computer science. There
                are many types of search algorithms, such as Linear search,
                Binary search.

                A sort algorithm is a method for arranging elements in lists or
                sequences into a particular order. The most frequently desired
                orders are numerical order and lexicographical order, and the
                efficiency of an algorithm is determined by its performance in
                terms of time and space complexityâ€”specifically, how fast it can
                sort and how much memory it requires.

                Binary search is an example of how an appropriate algorithm can
                save time. If you have a list of 1,000,000 numbers, linear
                search could, in the worst case, require 1,000,000 checks, while
                binary search would only require a maximum of 20 checks! wow!

              <p>
                In computational terms, linear search could take hours and
                significant processing power for large datasets, whereas binary
                search could take seconds, saving energy and freeing up
                computational resources for other tasks.

                As datasets grow larger, the shortcomings of linear search
                become more apparent, and the benefits of binary search become
                more valuable. This is true in many areas of computing, such as
                database lookups, file retrieval, and handling large-scale web

            Data Structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer
            so that it can be used effectively. Common examples of data
            structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and
            graphs. The choice of a data structure often depends on the specific
            needs of the algorithm or application, such as how data is accessed,
            manipulated, and stored. Efficient data structures can significantly
            improve the performance of an algorithm.
